### In otter news...

Since the last update post I have made some significant upgrades to OtterTV+ and the network infastructure.

First of all, OtterTV+ now has a brand new look with a more upkept theme which replaces the Theme Manager plugin. It'll take some time to get used to the new layout of everything but I believe this new theme is just what the doc ordered. You'll see this new theme on Desktop and Mobile.

Next we have some new plugins, with the major one being 'Jellyfin Enhanced'. This add new keyboard shortcuts, easy access to settings, the ability to request movies and shows via the Jellyfin interface, view where else media is available (Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, etc.), and the ability to search Jellyseer from the search bar (just click on the Jellyfin Icon to show Jellyseerr search results).

From now on please use the Jellyfin interface on Desktop or Mobile to request movies as it seems to be more reliable than the Jellyseerr site which seems to be a bit unstable at the moment.

I have also managed to finally replace all the Jellyfin logos with the OtterTV+ Logo. You will see this change on Desktop, Mobile, and on Roku. An into splashscreen may also get added in the future. ;)

Specials have also been fixed for TV Shows. Now they will display both in the "Specials" season and within the season they pair with. For example, the Sherlock special that aired after Season 3 but before Season 4 displays at the end of Season 3.

Finally, here is the new/updated media on the server:

* Movies:
    * Titanic (Upgraded from 480p to 1080p)
* TV Shows:
    * Doctor Who (2005-2021)
        * This does include the 60th Anniversary Specials but does not include the new Disney-era Doctor Who staring Ncuti Gatwa (which is its own seperate series)
    * Blue Bloods - Season 13
        * No idea why it was missing but it's fixed now

Still to do:

* Top Gun (1080p -> 4K)
* Top Gun Maverick (1080p -> 4K)
* Casin (1080p -> 4K)
* Oppenheimer (1080p -> 4K)
    * Honestly forgot about this one
* Apollo 13 (1080p -> 4K)
    * Also forgot about this one

Here's a meme to finish things off:
