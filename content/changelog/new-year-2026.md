## Happy (Late) New Year!

New Year, new media for the server. Today the following movies have been added to the server for your enjoyment:

* Constantine (2005)
* The Great Gatsby (1974)
* Ri¢hie Ri¢h (1994)
* Battleship (2012)
* Sully (2016)
* National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 (1993)
* Matilda (1996)
* Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022)
  * Don't ask how, just accept it

In other news I have also worked out the right settings for a program called Handbreak. This program allows me to take the ripped DVD & Bluray media and transcode it into H264 or H265 which helps reduce file sizes.

At some point I plan on going back through all the media stored on the server and running it through Handbreak so reduce the amount of storage space everything takes up. (Currently sitting at over 6TB of data!)

Handbreak is only set to transcode the video codec but not change its size or resolution. It's also set to only keep English and Spanish (Espanol) audio and subtitles.

Later this month I'll be ripping all the 4K Media I have and replacing the 1080p versions with it as H265 fixes the previous issues the server had with transcoding it to devices with the standard 4K Bluray video format.
