## Second time's the charm...

The migration to the new filesystem is complete and working great. It won't be the last time I do this but this will do for now. It will be a long time before I get around to buying high capacity drives and doing this process all over again.

I will be uploading the rest of The Legend of Kora today, that way I don't have to worry about it for the rest of Thanksgiving.
