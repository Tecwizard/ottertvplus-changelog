## Out with the old, in with the new


Currently the server is built with an old motherboard and AM4 processor I've had laying around for 10 years now. The two 2TB Drives in it are also almost at max capacity and the motherboard only supports four SATA devices without an HBA.

With Black Friday underway on Amazon, I decided to pull the trigger on a new CPU and Motherboard to go with the new 2TB hard drives I ordered yesterday. I already have the drive on hand and I'm waiting on the motherboard and CPU to be delivered later today.

The new specs of the server will be as follows:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5500 (6-Core, 12-Thread)
* RAM: 16GB Corsair Vengance LPX DDR4 2400MHz
* GPU: PNY Nvidia Quadro P620 2GB
* Motherboard: MSI ORI B550M-VC WiFi (Wifi will not be utilized)
* PSU: Thermaltake Smart 500W 80+
* HDDs: 
  * Segate BarraCuda 2TB 3.5in SATA Hard Drive (x3)
  * Lenovo Branded 256GB NVME SSD (Boot Drive, Spare I had from another system)
  * SP 512GB SATA SSD (x1)

I'm hoping to run the drives in a ZFS configuration for redundancy. I should have the server rebuilt with these new parts this weekend.

In other news, the following media will be added to the server after the rebuild is complete:

* Movies:
  * The Fifth Element
  * The Bad Guys
  * The Naked Gun Trology
  * Red One
  * The Naked Gun (2025)
* TV Shows:
  * Avatar: The Last Airbender
  * The Legend of Kora
  * Police Squad
