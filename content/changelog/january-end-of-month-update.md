### New Media, Old Media, New Hardware, oh my...

First thing's first, some new hardware. I've been looking into automating the media importing process and purchased a new 5.5" LG Bluray Drive (this thing was not easy or cheap to find) which I installed into the server last week. 

This was to be used in conjunction with ARM (Automatic Ripping Machine), a docker image that automaticall rips and transcodes media. While initial tests went well, I did ran into issues trying to get it to use my Handbreak profiles. Eventaully I gave up and ultimetly decided not to go forward.

I don't actually need to automate the process since my media library has already been manually ripped (That was a *fun* week long process) and I'm not ripping media that often. So for now I will leave the drive installed and use in in conjuction with a MakeMKV Docker Image then use a different computer to transcode the media with Handbrake.

Other than that here is the new media I added:

* Movies
    * The Menu (2022)
    * Bullet Train (2022) (4k HDR)
    * Peter Pan (1953)
    * Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium (2007)
    * The Karate Kid (1984)
    * The Karate Kid Part II (1986)
    * The Karate Kid Part III (1989)
    * Act of Vengance (2010)
        * This Movie is known as "Five Minarets in New York" globally but was renamed for the USA Release
    * Deck The Halls (2006)
        * Yeah I know it's late for a Christmas Movie but I found the DVD reorganizing the other day
    * The Karate Kid (2010)
* TV Shows
    * Sherlock (2010)

The following movies have been replaced with high-resolution versions:

* Back to the Future (1080p SDR -> 4K HDR)
* Back to the Future Part II (1080p SDR -> 4K HDR)
* Back to the Future Part III (1080p SDR -> 4K HDR)
* Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (1080p SDR -> 4K HDR)
* The Fifth Element (1080p SDR -> 4K HDR)
* Baby Driver (720p -> 1080p)
* Pokemon: Detective Pikachu (720p -> 1080p)
* Twisters (1080p SDR -> 4K HDR)

Movies left to replace with high-resolution versions:

* Titanic (480p -> 1080p)
    * The Bluray is on order and should be delivered next week.
* Top Gun (1080p SDR -> 4k HDR)
* Top Gun: Maverick (1080p SDR -> 4K HDR)
    * I just need to find time to borrow my brother's collector's set to rip the 4K Blurays
